This is the first paragraph. It should show up on the homepage as a preview. 

This is the rest of the post. It should only appear once you click "Read full post." Because I listed 5 images in the header but the homepage has a limit of 4, you should only see the first 4 on the timeline, but all 5 when you click into the post!
